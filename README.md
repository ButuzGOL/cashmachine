## What is cash machine ?
In our days there a lot of javascript client and backend side frameworks. But for best understanding we should do practice, so I created repo to write there the same app "cash machine" using different frameworks.  
It's something similar to [TodoMVC](https://github.com/tastejs/todomvc)
